"""
Find the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in an array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,5,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [0,1,2,3], therefore the length is 4.

Time Complexity:
- Dynamic Programming: O(nÂ²)
- Binary Search: O(n log n)
Space Complexity:
- Dynamic Programming: O(n)
- Binary Search: O(n)
