Longest Increasing Subsequence

Problem:
Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements
without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,5,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [0,1,2,3], therefore the length is 4.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [7], therefore the length is 1.

Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) for the dynamic programming solution
Space Complexity: O(n) for the dp array
